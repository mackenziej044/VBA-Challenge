# VBA-Challenge
this project will explore different stock data values

Goal: Create VBA scripts to calculate stock data from each quarterly worksheet tab. Calculate quarterly change and percent change. Include conditional formatting to convey differences in data. 

Challenges faced: Inconsistency in formulas from ws to ws - the script would work in one sheet but return an overflow error in the other.

Script Type: VBA Script to be used in MS Excel.

Credits: Work was completed in cooperation with Kelly Brookeshire and a Stack Overflow webpage on the "VBA Loop: How to get Ticker symbols into Ticker column?" thread:
